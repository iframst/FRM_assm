Use FRM_assm pipeline
=====================

It is reccomended to use this pipeline in a conda environment (see [install document](INSTALL.md))

Run the bash script 
    bash ./FRM_assm.sh

The script will ask for the full path to a folder containg demultiplexed reads. Each set of reads must be contained in a single .fastq file, with each .fastq file in the directory denoting an independent assmebly.
